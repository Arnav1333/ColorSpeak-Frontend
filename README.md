# 🎨 ColorSpeak – AI-Powered Color Palette Generator

ColorSpeak is a web-based tool that helps you generate color palettes that match your brand’s identity — powered by AI and color psychology.

Just describe your brand (e.g., *“minimal and modern”* or *“bold and confident”*), and ColorSpeak instantly gives you a tailored palette. You can also explore basic palettes, save your favorites, and discover helpful design & frontend resources — all wrapped in a clean UI with dark mode support.
